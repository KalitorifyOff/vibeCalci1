# Product Requirements Document: Flutter Calculator

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a modern, user-friendly calculator application for Android, built using the Flutter framework. The visual design and feature set are based on the provided reference image. The goal is to develop a production-ready application within a short timeframe.

## 2. Product Goal

To create a beautiful, intuitive, and efficient calculator app that provides a seamless user experience for performing basic and intermediate mathematical calculations. The final product should closely mirror the design and functionality of the reference image.

## 3. Target Audience

This application is for general Android users who need a reliable and easy-to-use calculator for everyday tasks, whether for personal, student, or professional use.

## 4. Functional Requirements

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| F-01 | Basic Arithmetic | User can perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), and division (รท). | Must-have |
| F-02 | Number Input | User can input numbers 0-9. | Must-have |
| F-03 | Decimal Input | User can input a decimal point (.) for floating-point calculations. | Must-have |
| F-04 | Calculation Display | The screen displays the current input, the ongoing operation, and the final result. The previous operation is shown above the main result line. | Must-have |
| F-05 | Clear (C) | A 'C' button that clears the current input and resets the calculation. | Must-have |
| F-06 | Equals (=) | An '=' button that computes and displays the final result of the expression. | Must-have |
| F-07 | Percentage (%) | A '%' button that calculates the percentage of a number. | Must-have |
| F-08 | Backspace | A backspace button (icon) to delete the last entered digit. | Must-have |
| F-09 | History | A history button (icon) that allows the user to view a list of their recent calculations. | Should-have |
| F-10 | Memory Clear (MC) | An 'MC' button to clear any value stored in memory. (Note: M+, M- functionality is not shown but may be considered for future scope). | Should-have |
| F-11 | Settings | A settings button (icon) that could lead to future customization options (e.g., themes, sounds). For the initial version, this can be a placeholder. | Could-have |

## 5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Requirements

### 5.1. Visual Design

The UI must be a faithful reproduction of the provided reference image.

*   **Layout:** A full-screen calculator with a display area at the top and a button grid at the bottom.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Background:** Dark Charcoal (`#2D3035`)
    *   **Display Text:** White (`#FFFFFF`)
    *   **Number/Utility Buttons:** Light Gray (`#E0E0E0`) with dark text.
    *   **Function Buttons (`C`, `MC`, `%`):** Muted Purple/Blue (`#A5A9B4`)
    *   **Operator Buttons (`รท`, `x`, `-`, `+`):** Muted Purple/Blue (`#A5A9B4`)
    *   **Equals Button:** Bright Orange (`#FF8C00`)
*   **Buttons:**
    *   Buttons should have rounded corners.
    *   The '0' button should span the width of two standard buttons.
*   **Typography:** A clean, modern, sans-serif font should be used for all numbers and symbols.

### 5.2. UX

*   **Responsiveness:** The app must have a responsive layout that works on various Android screen sizes.
*   **Feedback:** Buttons should provide clear visual feedback when pressed (e.g., a slight change in color or elevation).
*   **Haptics:** (Optional) Subtle haptic feedback on button presses to enhance the user experience.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| NF-01 | Platform | The application must be built for the Android platform. |
| NF-02 | Technology | The application must be developed using the Flutter framework and Dart. |
| NF-03 | Performance | The application must be fast, with no noticeable lag during calculations or UI interactions. |
| NF-04 | State Management | The app should properly handle its state, preserving the current calculation across configuration changes (like screen rotation). |

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

*   The initial development will focus on implementing the "Must-have" and "Should-have" features.
*   Advanced scientific functions (e.g., sin, cos, tan, log) are out of scope for this version.
*   The primary goal is to match the reference design on Android.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   The application is successfully built and deployed to an Android device or emulator.
*   All functional requirements listed as "Must-have" are fully implemented and bug-free.
*   The final UI is visually indistinguishable from the provided reference image.
*   The app receives positive user feedback on its design and usability.
