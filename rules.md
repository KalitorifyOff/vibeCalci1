# Operational Rules

These rules govern our interaction and development process:

- **File Deletion Confirmation:** Always seek explicit confirmation from me before deleting any files.
- **Sensitive Data Protection:** Never attempt to read, access, or store sensitive data such as API keys, credentials, or other confidential information.
- **Test-Driven Development (Post-Functionality):** After completing the implementation of any functionality, immediately proceed to create corresponding test cases for it.
- **Automated Testing & Git Push:** Only after all test cases have been successfully run and passed, should the code be pushed to the Git repository.
- **Step-by-Step Confirmation:** Before initiating any new development step or task, always ask for my confirmation.
- **Mark as Checked:** Once a step is completed, mark it as checked in `@plan.md` before pushing to Git.
